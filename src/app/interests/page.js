          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors. I am an avid football player and novice swimmer. During the
          colder months here in Accra, I enjoy biking, running, hiking and
          nature walks. .

          When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
          movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a
          large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
          advancements in the front-end web development world.
